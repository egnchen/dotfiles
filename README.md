# Dotfiles

This repo contains my various dot files(configuration files) and setup scripts for POSIX(Linux/MacOS) environments.

## Usage

Use the following command line. To mitigate Github connection problem `ghproxy` is used here.

```sh
git clone https://ghproxy.com/https://github.com/eyeKill/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```
